## Type

Elastic sidechain network connected to Ethereum L1 through BLS Rollups. Allows deploying "Ethereum-as-a-Service" EVM-compatible blockchains through rental of node space on mainnet.

## Tx Cost

Gasless under a specific chain usage threshold, small increase once over the threshold to fend off DDoS attacks. Threshold increases with rented sidechain size.

## Finality

Finalization times depend on sidechain size and configuration, but generally sub-second.

## Consensus

Proof of Stake with Asynchronous Binary Byzantine Agreement Consensus.

## $ Efficient

Very efficient since you can adapt the sidechain size to developer needs. New applications can start with small and economic sidechain sizes and then grow together with their userbase.

## Max TPS

Up to 2000tps.
