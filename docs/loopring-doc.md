## Type

Chain-agnostic, L2 protcol based on zkRollups

## Tx Cost

450 gas (~$0.0002 on Ethereum as of 2021/01/14)

## Finality

Apparently immediate (off-chain), later verified on-chain

## Consensus

zkRollup

## $ Efficient

More capital efficient than main alternatives as long as off-chain cloud compute is cheaper than on-chain transactions (see table 1 [here](https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/01/05/rollup.html))

## Max TPS

2,025 with OCDA; 16,400 without
